As an electrical engineer with a solid background on power system and smart grid technologies, I am passionate for exploiting the power of machine learning technology and data science in solving complex real-world problems. 

In the recent years, technological advancements in distributed computing, internet of things, big data and cloud computing as well as many successful practical applications of the machine learning-based products and services, have provided wide range of opportunities for almost every business sector in our industrial world. Examples include but not limited to healthcare, digital media industry, IT industry, supply chain, etc. However, the practical application of machine learning technologies in industries and critical infrastructure sectors, specifically in time sensitive and critical decision-making applications, are often restricted by many limiting factors such as privacy, security, and publicly available data. 

<!-- I have 8+ years of experience in variety of topics related to the power system and smart grid.  -->
Considering my interest and knowledge of the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) and data science techniques, the overarching goal of my research is to exploit the power of ML and artificial intelligence techniques in solving real-world problems.  
<!-- I am highly interested in solving the real-world problems of complex systems (e.g., power systems, eMobility networks, etc.) by exploiting the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques.  -->

I joined Arizona State University (ASU) in Fall 2019, and am currently pursuing my PhD degree at the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, working under supervision of Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/">Oliver Kosut</a> and  <a href="https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/">Lalitha Sankar</a>. 
Currently I am focusing on the application of ML and data science in identifying various types of events in power systems using the huge amount of high-dimensional Spatio-temporal data obtained from GPS-synchronized measurement devices (Click <a href="https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/high-dimensional-spatio-temporal-data-science-for-a-resilient-power-grid-towards-real-time-integration-of-synchrophasor-data/">here</a> for further details.).

I have been fortunate to directly work with outstanding professors, experts, and researchers in the area of statistics, information theory, machine learning, big data and data science. 
Through my experience in multiple, large interdisciplinary and collaborative research projects,  the  importance of having a fundamental knowledge of computer science has significantly been highlighted, specifically when designing and developing a production level machine learning pipeline. 
Having this in my mind, I have been constantly working on strengthening my knowledge in fundamentals of computer science (e.g., algorithms and data structures, dynamic programing, cloud computing, and distributed computation concept) and skills in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, signal processing and time series analysis.

<!-- My research interest and experience focuses on: 

<ul>
  <li> Machine learning (ML) and data science application in power system operation </li>
  <li> Power system dynamics and stability </li>
  <li> Resilience in critical infrastructure networks </li>
  <li> Battery energy storage systems and their integration to renewable energy sources </li>
</ul> -->

<!-- My undergraduate and master's studies significantly helped me to improve my knowledge in the area of electrical engineering and fundamentals of power systems. During my PhD studies, I have been fortunate to directly work with outstanding professors and researchers who are expert in the area of statistics, machine learning, big data and data science, and therefore, I was able to enhance my knowledge and understanding in these fields as well. 

Considering my research experience on a variety of topics related to power systems as complex dynamical systems and my interest and knowledge of the state-of-the-art machine learning and data science techniques, my overarching goal is to develop and apply machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques:  



* to address issues affecting power system security, reliability, stability, and resilience
* to provide practical solutions to enhance the integration of EVs, renewable energy sources, and battery energy storages to acheive the Net Zero Emissions target by 2050 -->

During my PhD, I have been actively working on various research projects. These projects were supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants  <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1934766&HistoricalAwards=false">OAC-1934766</a>,  <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2048223&HistoricalAwards=false">CCF-2048223</a>, and <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2029044&HistoricalAwards=false">CCF-2029044</a> , by the Power System Engineering Research Center (PSERC) under Project S-87 (final report is
available online <a href="https://documents.pserc.wisc.edu/documents/publications/reports/2021_reports/S_87_Final_Report.pdf">here</a> ), and in part by the U.S.-Israel Energy Center managed by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation (fpr further details, click <a href="https://us-isr-energycenter.org/energy_cyber/USIE.html">here</a>).
