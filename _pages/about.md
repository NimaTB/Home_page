<h2>Welcome to My Personal Homepage!</h2>
<p>I am Nima T. Bazargani, an electrical engineer specializing in power systems with a passion for leveraging machine learning and data science to solve intricate real-world challenges. 
Currently, I serve as a Network Model Analyst at <a href="https://www.cwpenergy.com/">CWP Energy</a>, where I conduct large-scale security-constrained unit commitment and economic dispatch simulations. 
</p>

<!-- <h2>Professional Expertise and Passion</h2> -->
<p>With over 10 years of research and industrial experience, I have deeply engaged in the following areas, which continue to fuel my enthusiasm and drive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Exploring electricity markets, with a focus on quantitative trading strategies for long-term financial transmission rights auctions, and financial hedging against the price risks of day-ahead congestion caused by transmission system constraints.
</li>

    <li>Applying machine learning (ML) and data science to enhance power system monitoring, operation, stability, and reliability. </li>
    <!-- My work in this field has allowed me to develop and implement innovative solutions that improve system performance and resilience. -->
    <li>Planning and operating power systems with a focus on resiliency. I am passionate about creating strategies that ensure reliable power delivery even in the face of abrupt disruptions and extreme events.</li>
    <li>Integrating battery energy storage systems with renewable energy sources. This area excites me as it combines cutting-edge technology with sustainable practices, contributing to a cleaner and more efficient energy future.</li>
</ul>
<p>These topics not only reflect my experience but also represent the areas I am eager and committed to continue working on, as I explore new challenges and opportunities in the evolving landscape of power systems and energy technology.</p>



<!--
<h2>Current Focus</h2>
 <p> -->

 <!-- This role involves providing critical insights into locational market clearing prices and transmission congestion costs for major North American electricity markets, including ERCOT, MISO, PJM, and SPP.-->
 
  <!--  In addition, I am focusing on applying machine learning and data science to identify various types of events in power systems using high-dimensional spatio-temporal data obtained from GPS-synchronized measurement devices. -->

<h2>Academic Journey</h2>
<p>I joined Arizona State University (ASU) in Fall 2019 and have completed a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/">Professor Oliver Kosut</a> and <a href="https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/">Professor Lalitha Sankar</a>. My dissertation, supported by the National Science Foundation, focuses on real-time identification of power system events using high-dimensional spatio-temporal PMU data, reflecting my commitment to advancing the field of power systems through innovative research. <a href="https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/high-dimensional-spatio-temporal-data-science-for-a-resilient-power-grid-towards-real-time-integration-of-synchrophasor-data/">Explore further details here</a>.</p> 


<!-- <h2>Research and Projects</h2> -->
<p>During my Ph.D., I have actively contributed to various significant research projects supported by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The National Science Foundation under Grants <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1934766&HistoricalAwards=false">OAC-1934766</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2048223&HistoricalAwards=false">CCF-2048223</a>, and <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2029044&HistoricalAwards=false">CCF-2029044</a>.</li>
    <li>The Power System Engineering Research Center (PSERC) under Project S-87. <a href="https://documents.pserc.wisc.edu/documents/publications/reports/2021_reports/S_87_Final_Report.pdf">Final report available online here</a>.</li>
    <li>The U.S.-Israel Energy Center managed by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) foundation. For further details, click <a href="https://us-isr-energycenter.org/energy_cyber/USIE.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These projects have enhanced my expertise in integrating statistical theories, machine learning, and data science to solve complex power system challenges focusing on applications involving time series classification and forecasting. <!-- My work has consistently involved designing and developing machine learning pipelines,  -->
<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>Beyond my professional work, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me engaged and inspired:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reading, with a keen interest in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.</li>
    <li>Outdoor activities like hiking, camping, kayaking, and off-roading.</li>
    <li>Solving puzzles, including challenging metal brain teasers and wire puzzles.</li>
</ul>
