Experienced graduate research associate with 6+ years of research experience
in power system planning, operation, security with focuses on: machine learning (ML)
and data science application for real-time integration of Synchrophasor data,
power system dynamics and stability, resiliency-oriented planning and operation of 
power system, battery energy storage systems and their integration to renewable energy sources in Microgrids, and optimization methods applied for power system optimal planning and operation.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy 
Engineering @Arizona State University, AZ, USA. Along with my advisors, Dr. Lalitha Sankar
and Dr. Oliver Kosut, we are working on the application of machine learning (ML) techniques 
in identifying various types of events in power systems using the huge amount of 
high-dimensional Spatio-temporal data obtained from GPS-synchronized 
phasor measurement units (PMU) devices. 


Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
